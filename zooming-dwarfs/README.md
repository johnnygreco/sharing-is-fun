# How far is a galaxy?

These are animations based on the `ArtPop` simulations from our paper on [measuring distances to low-luminosity galaxies using surface brightness fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07273). Please feel free to use them (with proper attribution). The individual frames for each age are in the associated directories. 

Each galaxy is composed of a single-age stellar population with a mass of 1 million solar masses, an effective radius of 550 pc, and a stellar metallicity of 3% the solar value. The galaxy ages are indicated in the images.
